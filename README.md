# NAME

Net::EPP - a Perl library for the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)

# DESCRIPTION

EPP is the Extensible Provisioning Protocol. EPP (defined in
[STD 69](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/std69)) is an application-layer
client-server protocol for the provisioning and management of objects stored in
a shared central repository. Specified in XML, the protocol defines generic
object management operations and an extensible framework that maps protocol
operations to objects. As of writing, its only well-developed application is the
provisioning of domain names, hosts, and related contact details.

This package offers a number of Perl modules which implement various EPP-
related functions:

- a low-level protocol implementation ([Net::EPP::Protocol](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net%3A%3AEPP%3A%3AProtocol));
- a low-level client ([Net::EPP::Client](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net%3A%3AEPP%3A%3AClient));
- a high(er)-level client ([Net::EPP::Simple](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net%3A%3AEPP%3A%3ASimple));
- an EPP frame builder ([Net::EPP::Frame](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net%3A%3AEPP%3A%3AFrame));
- a utility library to export EPP response codes
([Net::EPP::ResponseCodes](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net%3A%3AEPP%3A%3AResponseCodes)).
