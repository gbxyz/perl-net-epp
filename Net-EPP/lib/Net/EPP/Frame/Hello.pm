=head1 NAME

Net::EPP::Frame::Hello - an instance of L<Net::EPP::Frame> for client greetings

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a subclass of L<Net::EPP::Frame> that represents EPP client
greetings.

Clients can send a greeting to an EPP server at any time during a session.
According to the EPP RFC, the server must transmit an EPP greeting frame to the
client upon connection, and in response to an EPP C<E<lt>helloE<gt>> command.
The C<E<lt>greetingE<gt>> frame provides information about the server,
including the server time, access control rules, and a list of the object
types that are provisioned by the server.
